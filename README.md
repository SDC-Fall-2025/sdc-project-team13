**Cache** is a discord bot that helps with managing, leading, and contributing to SDC team projects.

Using bot commands and natural language interaction, Cache can track progress, offer programming advice, create/manage projects and scheduling, and integrate with tools such as [Cal.com](https://cal.com) and [GitHub](https://github.com) for real-time activity monitering.
